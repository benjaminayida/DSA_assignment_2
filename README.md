### Question 1

The main task in this problem set is to create an extension for the calculator flask app from
lab 3. In addition to the basic calculator that we created in the lab, this extension should
have a page on which a user can calculate the perimeter of a circle by inputting the radius.
For the calculation of the radius, you should create a Circle class, with one method to
calculate the perimeter and one method to calculate the area of the circle. You should write
one unit test for each of these methods. To make this task easier, start by cloning this
repository https://github.com/lenafm/calculator app to begin with a working version of the
calculator app from the lab.
You will submit your code as a Pull Request to the repository github.com/lenafm/calculator app.
We will then check whether your code runs correctly and whether your tests do what they
are supposed to. Please provide a link to the Pull Request in the document you submit on
Moodle (along with your answers to questions 2 and 3).
For full marks, you should:

* (4 points) Write the Circle class (with the perimeter and area methods) in a separate
python module (like helper.py, in the repository) called circle.py and import it into
the main flask module.

* (4 points) Create a template similar to the ’calculator.html’ template, with an HTML
form in which the user can input the radius, and render this template from the main
module
* (4 points) Create a test circle.py file in the root directory, which tests the two methods
in the circle.py module
